## Technologies

* JavaScript: Node and Express

## User Stories
* As a new user, I would like to be able to see all events
* As a new user, I would like to be able to create an account 
* As a user, I would like to be able to log in
* As a user, I would like to be able to see all events/posts
* As a user, I would like to be able to RSVP to an event
* As a user, I would like to be able to Post an event
* As a user, I would like to be able to Update(Edit) my event
* As a user, I would like to be able to Delete my event
* As a user, if I’m signed in, I would like to be able to log out

## MVP
1. Allow users to register for an account with username, email and password
2. Allow users to log in with email and password, as well as sign out
3. Allow all users(registered or not) to see (get) all events as well as specific event details
4. Allow signed in user to create, update, and delete their own events
5. Allow signed in users to RSVP to events

## Stretch Goals
1. Allow users to send messages to all RSVP’d users for their created event
2. Allow users to receive a notification for reminder of events
3. Allow users to search events by game title (hitting igdb api for images and title names?)
4. Allow users to host different types of events (tournaments, casual gaming, etc.)
